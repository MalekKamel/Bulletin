# Bulletin 
An abstraction for alert messages in android.

More and more you need to report bulletins (messages) to the user and you spread its code everywhere. And sometimes you ask yoursef, what if I want to avoid duplicate bulletins at the same time? what if I want to queue bulletins? what if I want to apply default configurations to each bulletin only in one place? what if I want to manage all bulletins?.....  👿 👿

**Bulletin** can answer all you queustions!  🙏 🙏

## Bulletins
any widget implements [Bulletin_Interface](#bulletin-interface) is a Bulletin. There're 4 predefined widgets in the library:
- [] **InfoDialog**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinDialog`
- [] **InfoSheet**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinSheet`
- [] **StandardFlashBar**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinFlashBar`
- [] **StandardToast**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinToast`

## Bulletin Interface:
`Bulletin` is implemented by all widgets of the library. If you want to create your custom bulletin, you must implement this interface.

``` kotlin
interface Bulletin {
    val name: String
    val content: String
    fun showBulletin(activity: FragmentActivity?)
    fun dismiss()
}
```
