An abstraction for alert messages in android.

More and more you need to report bulletins (messages) to the user and you spread its code everywhere. And sometimes you ask yoursef, what if I want to avoid duplicate bulletins at the same time? what if I want to queue bulletins? what if I want to apply default configurations to each bulletin only in one place? what if I want to manage all bulletins?.....  üëø üëø

**Bulletin** can answer all you queustions!  üôè üôè

## Bulletins
Any widget implements [Bulletin Interface](#bulletin-interface) is a Bulletin. There're 7 predefined widgets in the library:
- [ ] **InfoDialog**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinDialog`
- [ ] **RetryDialog**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinDialog`
- [ ] **LoadingDialog**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinDialog`
- [ ] **InfoSheet**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinSheet`
- [ ] **RetrySheet**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinSheet`
- [ ] **StandardFlashBar**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinFlashBar`
- [ ] **StandardToast**: a concrete implementaion of `BulletinToast`

## Bulletin Interface
`Bulletin` is implemented by all widgets of the library. If you want to create your custom bulletin, you must implement this interface.

``` kotlin
interface Bulletin {
    val name: String
    val content: String
    fun showBulletin(activity: FragmentActivity?)
    fun dismiss()
}
```
## Alertable Interface
Alertable interface contains a group of default functions that make it easy to show any predefined `Bulletin`. If you want to make all these functions available for your class, just implement it. The interface is a composite of interfaces for each bulletin. Take a look at [The code](https://github.com/ShabanKamell/Bulletin/blob/master/lib/src/main/java/com/sha/bulletin/Alertable.kt) to see all functionalities.

``` kotlin
interface Alertable:
        InfoDialogAlertable,
        InfoSheetAlertable,
        RetryDialogAlertable,
        RetrySheetAlertable,
        ToastAlertable,
        LoadingDialogAlertable,
        FlashBarAlertable
```
## BulletinManager
It's the brain of the library that's responsible for showing/hiding bulletins, storing the current state of each bulletin and checking if a bulletin is displayed. Take a look at [The code](https://github.com/ShabanKamell/Bulletin/blob/master/lib/src/main/java/com/sha/bulletin/BulletinManager.kt) to see all functionalities.

## Custom Bulletins
As mentioned in [Bulletin Interface](#bulletin-interface), you can create your custom bulletin by implementing [Bulletin] interface. Alternatively, you can extend abstract widget like `BulletinDialog` and implement your customization.
